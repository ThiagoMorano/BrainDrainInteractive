Forest Level:

- Player can skip level at beginning
- Traversable path unclear if player enters forest
- More rocks with fucked up UVs
- Player can fall out of the map
- Cigarette and fire not aligned
- Some trees floating
- Graphical glitches at fences
- Can't enter entrance of hut -> inconsistent
- Wildfire avoids character when approached -> might break immersion
