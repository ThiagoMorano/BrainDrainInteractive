Forest Level:

- Player can skip level at beginning
- Traversable path unclear if player enters forest
- More rocks with fucked up UVs
- Player can fall out of the map
- Cigarette and fire not aligned
- Some trees floating
- Graphical glitches at fences
- Can't enter entrance of hut -> inconsistent
- Wildfire avoids character when approached -> might break immersion

Office Level:

- Torso blocked by cabinets -> Player might not know where to go.
- Document seal at dokument to go up clipped into cabinet -> makes character spaz out
- Same cabinet: Can get stuck between wall and document when pushed
- Bottom labyrinth walls not perfectly positioned
- Office labyrinth wall textures not consistent
- Plyer can get stuck at chair in corner of labyrinth (M_chair_v16)
- Player can walk past wallrun document (M_Wallrun_Document_Document11 & 12)
- Wallrun document at monitor doesn't work
- Player can walk past blockage cabinet (M_FileCabinet8)
- File Cabinets get stuck when pushed (BP_PushableObject3,4,5)
- Camera clips through upper plattform during cutscene
- Roof of upper level extremely dark -> seems like missing textures/light
- Color pallet clips through ground easily -> looks weird and makes it hard to push
- Glass floor on upper level makes it harder to tell where the objects need to be pushed
- Pushing objects down entrance to upper level possible -> makes level unbeatable
- Character can fall through hole onto scale -> might be annoying
- Level is cheesable: Player can drop onto scale arm from top and reach end platform by walking on scale arm.

Atelier:

- Wallrun very choppy
- Wallrun doesn't work if camera sideways
- Glow on hands sometimes doesn't disappear

Conclusion:

- Ground texture glitchy
- Wall texture blurred/distorted
- Wall next to final door is either transparent or reflective, but doesn't look right either way
- Final plattform can be reached without floating plattforms (Cheese)
- No mouse cursor after fade to credits (if there ever was one)

Hub:

- Can't get back on center after leaving it, might be confusing
- Torso can be skipped entirely by going directly to arms door
